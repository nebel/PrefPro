description: |-
  Your character is personal, so you should be able to have NPCs refer to them
  the way that you want. With PrefPro, you can control which text option
  will appear when an NPC uses dialogue meant for a specific in-game gender.
  This allows you to use a female player model and be referred to as male, and
  vice versa. In addition, there are a few name customization options - if you
  want to only be referred to by your last name, so be it.
  Note: This plugin currently will not swap voiced cutscene dialogue.
punchline: Changes in-game dialogue to referece your desired gender and name.
